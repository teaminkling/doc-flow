# Inkling Flow

A simple but robust configuration management process using ZenHub.

## Flow

### Change Management

1. Create an issue for each logical change (bug or feature).
   - Each issue has an Assignee.
   - Each issue has a Milestone.
2. Create Milestones as necessary.
3. Plan large changes using `Epic`s.
4. Each Milestone has a versioned Release.

### Release Documentation

> `ink-release` performs automation for this.

1. Release by pushing a tag e.g., `pre-1.2.11`, `pre-0.18.0-rc2`.
2. Automate tagging of `1.2.11` and `pre-0.18.0-rc2` leading to GitHub Releases etc (as required).
3. `main` branch is stable.

### Versioning and Branching

Just use [Semantic Versioning][semver-link]. Remember that `MAJOR` is only incremented from `0` to 
`1` on a first stable release; breaking changes before `1.0.0` are expected.

Branching is:

- Based on GitHub Flow (trunk).
- Uses merge commits on completion of a ticket.
- Encourages rebasing before merges.

Specifically:

- `main` containsÂ `dev` code.
  - Deploys: `0.1.13-dev+2`.
- Tags contain production versions.
  - Deploys: `0.1.13`.
- `issue` branches (based on the issue number and description) are unstable.
  - Does not deploy/unversioned.

## Practices

### Maintainer Documentation

> `ink-version` helps with this.

1. Document your `README.md` file with build and deploy instructions.
2. Automate versioning in `package.json` and similar package metadata files.

### Extra Considerations

- Code qualimetry should run locally and in each pull request via Actions.
- Definitely try to follow Test-Driven Development/Behaviour-Driven Development.
- Set up code coverage at least before `1.0.0`.
